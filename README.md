## Problem Title  
**SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers**  

---

## Problem Description  
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.  

### Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved  
Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.  

### Expected Outcomes  
- A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.  
- Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.  
- Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.  
- Pest/disease detection via image uploads.  
- Market price tracking.  
- Voice support for low-literate users.  
- Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.  

### Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries  
- Small and marginal farmers  
- Agricultural extension officers  
- Government agriculture departments  
- NGOs and cooperatives  
- Agri-tech startups  

### Supporting Data  
- 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).  
- Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution  
We propose a **multilingual, AI-driven mobile and web platform** that provides farmers with personalized crop advisory.  

- **Crop Selection & Planning:** Suggests the best crop based on soil health, weather, and market demand.  
- **Soil & Fertilizer Recommendations:** Integrates soil test results to provide balanced fertilizer use, reducing costs and chemical overuse.  
- **Pest & Disease Management:** Farmers can upload crop images for pest/disease detection using computer vision models.  
- **Weather-based Alerts:** Real-time integration with weather APIs to notify farmers of rain, drought, or heatwave conditions.  
- **Market Price Insights:** Displays local mandi prices to help farmers choose the best time and place to sell crops.  
- **Voice & Language Support:** Accessible in regional languages with voice-based commands for low-literacy users.  
- **Continuous Learning:** Feedback loop to improve advisory quality based on farmer usage data.  

**Innovation:** Unlike generic apps, our system will be **localized, AI-powered, and farmer-friendly**, ensuring maximum adoption and impact.

## Technical Approach  
**Technologies to be used:**  
- **Frontend:** React Native / Flutter (for cross-platform mobile app)  
- **Backend:** Django / FastAPI (Python)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MongoDB  
- **AI/ML Models:** TensorFlow / PyTorch for pest detection & recommendation engine  
- **APIs:** OpenWeather API, Government soil/market data APIs  
- **Cloud Hosting:** AWS / Azure / GCP  

**Methodology & Process:**  
1. Collect farmer details (location, soil type, crop history).  
2. Run AI models for recommendations (crop choice, fertilizer, pest management).  
3. Provide advisory through app, chatbot, and voice-based support.  
4. Send real-time notifications (weather alerts, market prices).  
5. Gather feedback and improve models.

## Feasibility and Viability  
- **Feasibility:**  
  - Smartphone penetration in rural India is increasing (cheap Android devices).  
  - Farmers already use WhatsApp → chatbot interface ensures adoption.  
  - Existing datasets (soil health cards, mandi prices, weather APIs) are available.  

- **Challenges:**  
  - Limited digital literacy.  
  - Internet connectivity in remote villages.  
  - Accuracy of AI models.  

- **Strategies to Overcome:**  
  - Regional language + voice support.  
  - Offline caching with periodic sync.  
  - Collaborations with agriculture universities for dataset improvement.

## Impact and Benefits  
- **Social:** Empowers farmers with scientific decision-making tools.  
- **Economic:** Reduces unnecessary input costs, increases crop yield and income.  
- **Environmental:** Prevents overuse of fertilizers/pesticides → sustainable farming.  
- **Government:** Helps track crop trends, supports policymaking.
